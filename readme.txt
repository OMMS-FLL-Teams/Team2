Old Mill Middle School Team 2 (# XXXXX ) FLL Source Code and Robot/Attachment Design Repository

Each FLL season's source code is posted here to help teams understand how to use Pybricks and our robot library. Unless you have our exact robot design, configuration, and attachments the code will not work directly for your robot. Hopefully you find it useful!

We are part of Maryland FLL Challenge (https://marylandfll.org)
